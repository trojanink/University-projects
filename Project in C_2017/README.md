In every folder there is a more detailed description of each project in Greek langueage.

You will implement a movie review application. Your application will study a collection of reviews that have already been evaluated and based on the data it will collect will be able to evaluate new reviews entered from the keyboard. The data your application will use is a collection of several thousand movie reviews each of which has already been rated 0-4 with the mean: 0 - negative 1 - somewhat negative 2 - neutral 3 - somewhat positive 4 - positive.
The data provided in a text file. Each line of the file contains the rating of a
review and after the text of this review. We will give you a ready-made function which in each
her call returns the next line of the file.

Your program should extract the words of each review and store them in a structure
data that we will describe to you along with a score that results from its rating
criticism.

After all the data has been collected, the program asks the user to enter a new, non-rated
critique and based on the scores he has already calculated to evaluate it based on the above scale.
In addition, the program must count retrospectively the word that has the best score of all
have already been entered into the data structure.
