 It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
Bearable .   
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke   
This is an amazing movie !
What a chore it was to get through this disaster of a movie
The worst film of the year
Not too bad , but I expected better
What a delightful little film !
DONE
