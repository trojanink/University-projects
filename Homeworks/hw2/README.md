# Toll Station (Homework 2)

A program used by a fully automated toll station to collect data on vehicles passing through the station. The program detects and stores the type of each passing vehicle, the license plate and the amount owed by the driver (some drivers pass the tolls without paying the full amount owed). After collecting all the information, it locates vehicles that have passed multiple times to keep only one entry per vehicle and finally calculates and prints statistics on vehicle debts.

Here are detailed instructions on how your program should work and what functions it should contain.
